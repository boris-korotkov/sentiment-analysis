This company mistakenly took a large sum of money from our bank account.  Our bank refused it but warned me they could try and do this again.  Sun Life have offered us a very small sum as recompense.   The direct debits are all over the place.   Totally unacceptable.  Do research, check the other negative reviews and chose another company to do business with.</li><li><strong>Can't Unsubscribe from Sun Life Financial Spam - Score: 0.3953</strong><br/>About a year ago I had a policy with Sun Life, and when I quit the job that policy was terminated. But I still get spam from Sun Life Financial. There is no way to unsubscribe from it.There's no Sun Life Financial email, and the spam is sent from an un-monitored account. I've tried calling, but just get shunted around their phone maze until they hang up on me.Sun Life, please put an unsubscribe in your emails and honour that request.</li><li><strong>Steal your money. - Score: 0.3944</strong><br/>Had to leave my job, so pulled my DCCP from sunlife which was told it was at $1267. Told there was $75 fee and taxes, that's fine. Get a check for $896 which says my taxes were $99.57... so doesn't add up. Nobody will get back to me. They've changed my statement of account. Nobody will get back to me. Guess the $196 was worth getting a 1 star review and I'll be sure to plaster this on other social media unless fixed.</li><li><strong>My husband died 28/12/21 - Score: 0.3936</strong><br/>My husband died 28/12/21. He had an insurance policy paying out just over £5000 and even though they have had the required documents since February I still haven’t received settlement. This has caused immense stress and frustration. You cannot contact anyone on the phone neither do they reply to emails within five days. My last one was sent to them on 6th April and I’m still waiting to hear why I haven’t received payment. My husband took this policy out so as I was able to pay for his funeral without enduring stress. What a joke.</li><li><strong>Health insurance through Sunlife. - Score: 0.3912</strong><br/>Health insurance through Sunlife.The service is weak. Difficult to use the platform. No assistance at all online in the chat and on the phone it takes at least an hour to get someone on the line who does not know better than me.Since the beginning it hasn't been a good experience at all. Better access to info is a key point.</li></ol><h3>Top 5 Negative Reviews:</h3><ol><li><strong>Avoid at all Costs - Absolute Score: 0.3669</strong><br/>Archaic processes, 0/10 customer service, absolute joke of an organization as a whole.</li><li><strong>Trash-  horrible service - Absolute Score: 0.3649</strong><br/>Trash-  horrible service. make you jump through hoops. try to screw you out of mo ney.  brutal.</li><li><strong>I went to move my RRSP and non rrsp… - Absolute Score: 0.3556</strong><br/>I went to move my RRSP and non rrsp savings from Sunlife to my main banker. Well, Sunlife limits the amount you can withdraw at any given day and chargesyou $25 for the privilege. First time it was a larger amount but second time it was restricted at a smaller amount about 45% of the original. Again a $25 charge.  Never ever again will I invest money with this company!!!  If I could give them a negative 5 IRating I would. My advice, make auto payments at your bank to your rrsp or savings, DO NOT use these insurance companies for ANY savings. Crooks</li><li><strong>Update to the saga - Absolute Score: 0.3518</strong><br/>Update to the saga. 3rd Feb. Wrote email to CEO Mr Gary Bowden. Not in the office until 14th Feb. Told to contact Mary Charles-Head 07542 026698. Left a recorded message.Wrote email to Nicholas Shanahan who replied, apologising and telling me Ms Charles-Head would contact me to sort things out. Watch this space but don't hold your breath.Breathe again!Have received a reply from SLOC. A new software has caused problems which they are trying to resolve. This, coupled with staff shortages in complaints dept. due to Covid. These letters regarding missed payments and stopping of policies should be ignored. Let's hope that they can sort things out soon. Customer Relations Dept. seem to have been asleep and incapable of informing people of their in house problems.</li><li><strong>Poor, takes forever to get funds back - Absolute Score: 0.3515</strong><br/>The employer's savings plan is through Sunlife, so Sunlife was no my choice. A recent experience where they take their sweet time to correct a mistake made me to finally write a review here. Through human error, they processed a transfer of shares that was not supposed to happen. The other institution was contacted, finally shares were sent back to Sunlife remaining that Sunlife puts the shares back in my account. They told me that from the date they received the shares back they have 19 business days to process the correction and put the shares back in my account. Although I asked for the matter to be expedited, being it was through their error, they did nothing to process the transfer faster. 25 business days later and still don't have my shares back. My case manager tried to justify the delay the best he could and kept saying it's with the back end admin office for processing; somehow it looks that the customer service department and the mysterious back end office cannot communicate directly (or so it seems), as I cannot get a committed date for them to put the shares in my account. I am super disappointed with this experience and I would not recommend them to anybody. The only reason they got 2 stars is because the case manager is enough of a smooth talker to try to keep me calm when we follow up on the issue. It might be part of their strategy, to make you tired of the entire situation that you don't have the  strength to get upset anymore. Now I am just waiting and hoping I will get my shares back sooner rather than later. Being that this transaction was done through their error, I expected a bit more from them to fix the error.</li></ol></body></html>

When it comes to insurances they are fast to take care of your needs, sabrina umhire and nancy legault are the best team! Thank you for helping me on my very tough times, this help me a lot and my family with tge critical illness and disability claims!!! Fast service!!!</li><li><strong>Honestly Great - Score: 0.9997</strong><br/>This is a completely honest review, while we've had some frustrating call center experiences in the past with employees not knowing the information we needed to know, the vast majority of our interactions and claims with Sun Life have been very positive. Especially for an insurance company. Claims are processed quickly, coverage is amazing, calling is much quicker in terms of wait times now with the app, and some things like dental can be billed directly to them. I'm very happy and think everyone deserves coverage this good!</li></ol><h3>Top 5 Negative Reviews:</h3><ol><li><strong>Worst insurance company in Canada - Absolute Score: 0.9998</strong><br/>Worst insurance company in Canada. Thats all you need to know. Awful claims processing experience, they simply don't know what they are doing.</li><li><strong>Terrible customer service - Absolute Score: 0.9998</strong><br/>Terrible customer service.  The chat never functions (always says come back later - we are not available).  You send e-mails and it takes over a week for someone to respond.  Incompetent staff that is likely poorly trained and understands nothing about their own policies, let alone insurance! Useless company that would benefit by going bankrupt!</li><li><strong>Sun Life provides absolutely the worst… - Absolute Score: 0.9998</strong><br/>Sun Life provides absolutely the worst customer experience. Wait times for customer phone support is horrendous and the web site access is horrible (forces you to constantly change your password to login).</li><li><strong>Be careful with this company.They say one thing a do another - Absolute Score: 0.9998</strong><br/>Try to do things on the cheap.Extremely dishonourable and condescending.</li><li><strong>Appalling Service from Sun Life....As per previous review having an… - Absolute Score: 0.9998</strong><br/>As per previous review having an absolute disaster with this company - customer service appalling - can’t get through on phones - no response to my emails and now I have received the same letter saying my retirement fund has been STOPPED after 20 years of paying in - I have paid ALL PREMIUMS If anyone knows a way to get in touch please post - don’t know where to go next - only the FCA I assume!This is extremely poor from Sun Life Financial and not acceptable</li></ol></body></html>

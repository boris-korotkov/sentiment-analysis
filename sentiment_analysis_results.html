I been calling and waiting 2 hours without success, sent emails, automated email reply with a ticket number, sent complaint letter and another automated reply saying they will respond Within 5 days. It is now a week and I am still waiting. I am really despair, I am now retired. I sent a signed form with my choice how I wanted to receive my pension. I still haven’t heard from them. This is really unacceptable for such a big company. I will need to go towards the regulators to complain.  No excuse about covid according to the website there are 40,000 employees</li><li><strong>4 months now since requests sent by… - Score: 0.4250</strong><br/>4 months now since requests sent by mail and post to transfer my pension pot from Sun Life, since then they have used every excuse under the sun to delay, even sending offensive questionnaires that make out I am some stupid idiot.  Now they have 8 days left to comply  PRA and FCA now informed</li><li><strong>My policy has matured and funds sold as… - Score: 0.4164</strong><br/>My policy has matured and funds sold as of 5th December.  I have been advised that the proceeds should be returned to my account but they have withheld it and cannot tell me why they continue to hold my funds.  I am sure the regulators will be interested in why a regulated financial organisation is withholding funds that they have no further rights to and not providing a satisfactory response.Was promised a call back a week ago but still no response. This company is now illegally withholding my funds and causing me to miss financial commitments and financial difficulties.</li><li><strong>Company needs overhaul with their client services - Score: 0.4126</strong><br/>Our company has been with 3 different extended health insurance providers.  Sun Life is the worst.  I have no choice as I'm under group benefits.  We only left the previous 2 due to costs I believe but you do get what you pay for.  Sunlife has received so much feedback from me verbally (at least 2x) through their manager when I had to escalate an issue on more than one occasion.  I've also given feedback through email.  None of this has amounted to anything. More than 2 1/2 years later with them and the same issues are present.  Then they have the audacity to ask me to fill out a survey recently. I don't think they want to do anything with the survey.  They just want you think they care about your experience.   Here are my reasons for giving them a low rating:They are NOT client friendly.   They have made it very hard for you to get help.  Then their website is even worse.  It's done up for them and not for us as clients.  Here are only some examples of the top issues: 1. When trying to find information on a claim submission (and I have so many); why would I remember the date on which I submitted the claim?  Yet that is the information they choose to organize their info by.  I have the receipt in front of my so naturally having the service date makes more sense (which is what other companies provide).2.  They do not allow you to see the total of all claims accurately forcing me to have to go and total everything up.  They haven't figured out how to remove claims that were submitted more than once (due to their request for more information).  It is only one unique claim yet they will show it in the final summary as 2 claims.  What makes this so infuriating is that if they actually provided service date info for me to see it wouldn't be all that hard to add up all the unique service dates, but no, they only provide date of submission for the claim which makes it so confusing!3. There is no clear explanation of why you have the refund you have.  Other companies show that you have used up all your available funds and hence the amount remaining is what is left to only partially refund a claim.  This is not shown anywhere.  Only by sleuthing around am I able to see that but why should I have to do that?4. When it comes to income tax time and needing to get a final total of unpaid claims good luck.  Again I have to spend hours going through everything due to the messy information that they present you with.5.  With all the above said, I am then forced to have to call in to get help which then means they also have to go and look into my account.  But I'm put on hold forever before I can even get an agent.6. Their website won't even allow you to email them anymore.  "Ella" the virtual assistant is only available during short hours when I'm not.  So I cannot contact anyone nor leave an email.7.  There are no features allowing the client to organize the dependents information to view separately.  The mix in all claimants under one messy view.  Absolutely frustrating for me to look at when I cannot distinguish one claim from the next.I may not have explained all the problems well but I can definintely state that with our previous 2 insurance providers; using their websites to find information on my claims etc was logical, clear and very client friendly.  Sun Life if you're reading this, take a look at what clients with Greatwest Life can do on their website.  I've given you that suggestion already a few years ago.The date of experience that I had to put down is not Sep 9 2023.  It includes numerous experiences since January 2021 up till Sep 9 2023.</li><li><strong>Sun Life pension plans are the worst… - Score: 0.4111</strong><br/>Sun Life pension plans are the worst and they can't even answer if there is an alternative to Blackrock investments. They are worse than a TFSA</li></ol><h3>Top 5 Negative Reviews:</h3><ol><li><strong>Watch your monthly - Score: 0.3393</strong><br/>So... I moved, changed phone numbers and forgot to inform them. The ten year renewal came up and since I'm over 65 the monthly jumped to 245.00 a month and I just didn't see it for about 8 months. Just contacted to cancel, spoke to an agent who gave me some attitude and basically told me tough luck.. after over 30 years with these guys they weren't gonna budge. I kind of got the feeling that it was a set up, and I was talking to the guy that Sunlife puts on the phone to kiss off disgruntled clients. He knew exactly what to say to get rid of me.  So I've taken the loss, but I'll never forget. Goodbye Sunlife. You're a pretty creepy bunch.</li><li><strong>My husband has been waiting since the… - Score: 0.3422</strong><br/>My husband has been waiting since the beginning of August 2022 for his funds from his plan he is 57 years of age & was able to draw, down on his funds at 55 2020 He received a letter on 17 August 2022 confirming an enclosed pack application form on how to access his pension. This was completed immediately and was told he would receive his funds very shortly. At the time of requesting his funds the pot was just over £57,000 hence should have placed on hold with no change to the value of the policy at the actual date of setting the payout. Well it did change due to Lizz Truss mini budget on 28th September the fund value reduced to £53,590.85 !!!! £4,000 wiped out over 7 weeks after my husband requested his funds !!!!!! I have asked the Financial Ombudsman to review and made a serious complaint Fraud Scammers, Deceit, Not treating the customer fairly, stress inconvenience must I go on !! We were told the funds calculated now @ £37,569.76 after being taxed at Emergency Tax of which they advise we can request a rebate back from HRMC. Rachel, Craig, Leah Maspero all lied to us in regards to timescales, the customer service is shocking. We were then told on Friday 4th November the Chaps payments was made @ 4.30. Chaps "Clearing House Automated Payment System" this is a same day Bank to Bank Tranfer - Well it's Monday 11.19 7th November 2022 & again after several conversation with the most senior person allegedly working in the customer service team is Mr Lee Maspero as the actual Manager Laura P is away yet again she seems to be away all the time on calling this SCAM Company WE ARE STILL WAITING !!!! our Bank has checked there systems NO CHAPS HAS BEEN MADE FROM SUN LIFE FINANCIAL OF CANADA Made a complaint on the email provided this bounced back I've now written to Mr Kevin David Strain CEO who has earned published salary 30th December 2021 Total compensation $11.328 million to ask him where my money is !!!!Write to the CEO</li><li><strong>I don't why the I work for company… - Score: 0.3424</strong><br/>I don't why the I work for company deals with them.. very slow service over the phone.. very hard to find the detail of your coverage online.. they would put the policy number but no way you can find what's in the policy.. very awful long waits on the phone.. I got transferred to 4 different individuals without getting help.. Awful that they're in business with their terrible customer service.</li><li><strong>Marked improvement - Score: 0.3431</strong><br/>Have previously left a one star rating on this company about poor communication etc. but matters have improved significantly since then. Like many reviewers on here I sent letters and emails to the company earlier this year without reply and couldn't get through on the phone. However, in mid=May I rang for an update and got to speak to someone after 'just' 20 minutes. I was told that they had sent paperwork out to me in April but this had not been received. I advised that I hadn't seen this and requested that they resend and they duly obliged within 2 days. Paperwork was completed and returned. I rang again after a couple of days to check on matters and after a 5 minute wait was told that they were processing data and funds would be in my account within 10 working days. They were bang on and I'm now quids in!</li><li><strong>Sunlife dumps their problems onto their clients. - Score: 0.3432</strong><br/>Sunlife failsed to reiumburse legitimate costs for replacement frames for prescription sunglasses. We purchased prescription lenses and frames from a supplier and were reiumbursed by Sunlife. Then the frames broke and we returned to the same vendor to purchase new frames (since they are the ONLY supplier to provide these frames in the Calgary area). We submitted the receipt for reiumbursement and it was rejected by Sunlife who said they had since discontinued doing business with that supplier. All other insurance companies continue to deal with this provider in Calgary; the company is Sol Optix. Sunlife failed us because they suddenly have some undisclosed issue with this company. Stay away from Sunlife, they're not there when you need them.</li></ol></body></html>

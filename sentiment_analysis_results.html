To cut a long story short I applied to cash this in back in May after several calls eventually received the papers and returned them a few weeks later due to Having major surgery i did not chase up the papers immediately of course nothing arrived I perused this at the beginning of September where I was told they couldn’t locate the forms that they would reissue them and of course the amount would be honored I felt reassured by this when the market crashed a few weeks later Of course the paperwork didn’t arrive I called yet again and was told they had no record of my phone call!!I was also told that the policy had gone down by 2,000 but they would issue a complaint on my behalf which would enable them to trace my call and I would get a confirmation in 3-5 days of course nothing I again called yesterday spoke to Holly and then Ashley who was slightly senior who said I was given the wrong information and promised to call me back he didn’t sorry to bore on but am aware this will be sent to sun life which may be the only way to communicate with anyone who has any influence I won’t be holding my breath though!! Absolute debarcle of a company - Score: 0.4567</li><li>My company has group benefits with Sunlife and I have to say, their benefits are atrocious. I’ve gone back and fourth with my company and Sunlife only to realize it’s Sunlife that’s the problem.Firstly, their Fee Guide is WAY under the actual cost for services in Alberta. They expect us to either see a crappy health practitioner so it’ll be covered or expect you to pay out of your own pocket to see someone who is decent.Secondly, why do they not have more options for healthcare providers? Why does my “Pelvic Floor Physiotherapist” who specializes in Pelvic Floor and went to school for it so therefore charges more, only come under ‘Physiotherapist’.. so I have to pay an additional $50 of my own money because you won’t cover her…Another thing, say I have $2000 for either Physio, Massage, Chiro, Podiatrist etc.. why do you still only cover a portion of the cost of an appointment. If it’s coming out of my $2000 anyway, what does it matter if I want to spend more on a massage therapist? When it runs out, it runs out??And if my wisdom teeth removal costs over $2000 and I have $2000 for dental in total, why are you only covering $1,855.. when it’s covered ‘100%’ ??So that $105 gets wasted for the year when it could’ve made a huge difference in my portion I have to pay?And lastly, the wording they use is atrocious!! Saying they cover 100% for an eye exam every 24 months and then $300 towards eye glasses.Great, sounds reasonable right? WRONG, the eye exam which cost $105 comes out of the total $300!!!!!!! So I have $195 towards glasses? Not to mention I have to get prescription sunglasses too for driving. You will not find a new pair of prescription glasses where you have pretty poor eyes in Alberta.Insurance companies don’t care about its clients and it really shows. Sunlife, you’ve disappointed me in so many ways. If I ever get the choice to go with you again, I’ll happily refuse. AND I’ll tell every single person I know how terrible you are.Also, your customer service representatives are useless!! Not even a one star. - Score: 0.4363</li><li>My advice is NOT take Short-Term/Long-Term disability insurance if SunLife is offered through your employer. Based on my experience and several others it would be best to create a savings account or research other options.I signed up for supplemental disability insurance through my employer during open enrollment like many of us do, because of that worst case scenario.SunLife Financial was the only company that was offered and being that my employer was a multi-billion dollar resort company, I figured SunLife was a legitimate company, but I was so very wrong!Over a year later, I was diagnosed with what my urologist and oncologist described as a ‘very aggressive form of cancer that required immediate treatment involving surgery, radiation and hormone therapy.I was advised by my supervisor to leave work and begin drawing my supplemental disability benefits.Despite multiple reports from my team of doctors, Sunlife denied all claims. An appeal was filed and again denied, despite my complete inability to work which was documented my doctors.Nearly a year later, Sunlife relented and paid a portion the entire claim. By then, due to inability to work, and SunLife’s apparent policy of denying all claims, I had been evicted, lost my vehicle and was suffering from depression due to the whirlwind of negative actions resulting from SunLife’s continued denials.Their supposed customer service all the way to upper management are cold hearted in dealing with and seem to take pleasure in denying claimsStay far away from this scam of an insurance company! - Score: 0.4339</li><li>Seldom submit a claim and happy not to have to because Sun Life has the most miserable customer service agents, almost as if they resent getting a call. A decade ago they were helpful, pleasant as if they enjoyed their jobs. Not present day. - Score: 0.4230</li><li>I have a whole life policy with Sun Life and since January 2022, they have missed taking the direct debit on the odd month  They first accused me of missing payments. Informed them this policy has been running for over 35 years with no change in any details or bank collection account. Like many reviews I have been on hold for hours trying to contact customer service. I thought the matter had been sorted in August but sadly not, the issue has now arisen again with a failed collection in Septenber. As I write this review I have been on hold for 35 minutes and counting. This is a truly awful company and would advise that you do not do any business with this organisation. It's quite unbelievable that looking at all the reviews and problems people are experiencing the financial ombudman has not stepped in to make them get their house in order. If I have any problems when the policy us due for payment I would not hesitate to take immediate legal action. Avoid this company at all costs - Score: 0.4150</li></ol><h3>Top 5 Negative Reviews:</h3><ol><li>I enjoyed the service, thanks! - Score: 0.3411</li><li>Update to the saga. 3rd Feb. Wrote email to CEO Mr Gary Bowden. Not in the office until 14th Feb. Told to contact Mary Charles-Head 07542 026698. Left a recorded message.Wrote email to Nicholas Shanahan who replied, apologising and telling me Ms Charles-Head would contact me to sort things out. Watch this space but don't hold your breath.Breathe again!Have received a reply from SLOC. A new software has caused problems which they are trying to resolve. This, coupled with staff shortages in complaints dept. due to Covid. These letters regarding missed payments and stopping of policies should be ignored. Let's hope that they can sort things out soon. Customer Relations Dept. seem to have been asleep and incapable of informing people of their in house problems. - Score: 0.3442</li><li>I live in Indonesia, and clien of sunlife Indonesia for many years. but today I want to know about my polis and advantage from polis. I call to sun life and MARIA as customer service talk to me, many information I have gave her. but last her ask me about polis number, I tell her I dont know, and ask me how to pay, I answer again I dont know. Actually who will remember polis no. and pay method after 1 or 2 years, I think this is crazy question. and then deadlock. She can not give other solution.I dont think so big company as Sunlife have very bad customer service. As you know I have many insurance, not very complicated like this.I just ask about information mypolis, how if I claim??? I can not imagine.I tell to everyone pls be careful to insurance like this.Agent had gone, we can comunicate, go to insurance company very difficull to get information. why you know???? because they had got out money. If they need we buy insurance product everything very easy, If transaction done for 3 until 5 years, you will trouble, your money will gone. Big name of Sunlife, mean bad service and cheating - Score: 0.3481</li><li>Refused to transfer my money despite all forms being correct and sent twice. - Score: 0.3483</li><li>i have been with sunlife medical and dental family plan later  my daughter moved to over 25 yr old he own plan.It took from late August to mid October to get the date dental plan starts. Meanwhile Sunlife deducted monthly payment from my husband and myself existing and from my daughter's.After half a dozen call they finally say Nov 24 is when my daughter could book for dental cleaning. My daughter works full time on line and she allow authorization for me to get the Nov 24 info. Numerous phone long calls and signed papers sent from post office.Time spent is much frustrations. for over $600 a month Sunlife payment.Are all insurance like this? Representative not so helpful. Great in enrolling my daughter and even her phone number is outdated on the company letter! - Score: 0.3493</li></ol></body></html>
